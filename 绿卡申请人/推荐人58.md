**Subject: Request for a Recommendation Letter**

Dear Dr. Hussein A. Abbas,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to you to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter for my green card application.

I have been following your work closely, particularly your article titled "Reverse Phase Proteomic Array Profiling of Asparagine Synthetase Expression in Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia." Your comprehensive analysis and the use of reverse phase protein arrays to assess ASNS expression in a large cohort of AML patients have provided significant insights into the variability and prognostic significance of ASNS levels in AML. 

In your article, you referenced my work on the "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." Specifically, you highlighted the application of my enhanced gene set enrichment analysis methodology, which has been instrumental in identifying biologically relevant gene sets and pathways associated with various traits, as seen in the integration of ASNS expression data and its correlation with clinical outcomes in AML.

Given the relevance and connection between our research, I would be deeply honored if you could write a recommendation letter for my green card application. Your endorsement would significantly strengthen my application, highlighting the impact of my contributions to the field and the mutual benefits of our collaborative efforts.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there is anything I can provide to assist you with this request. I truly appreciate your consideration and time.

Thank you very much for your support.

Best regards,
