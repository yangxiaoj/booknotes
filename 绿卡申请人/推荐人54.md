**Subject: Request for a Recommendation Letter**

Dear Dr. Phil H. Lee,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. I am in the process of applying for a green card and am reaching out to seek your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been deeply impressed by your article, "Pathway analysis for genome-wide genetic variation data: Analytic principles, latest developments, and new opportunities," particularly your detailed discussion on multilocus analytic strategies that integrate biological knowledge into the statistical analysis of high-throughput genetics data. Your comprehensive review of the latest advancements in pathway analysis methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) closely aligns with my own research interests and work in bioinformatics.

In your article, you cited my work titled "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." Specifically, you referenced my contributions in the section where you introduced the basic concepts and motivations of pathway analysis steps. Your citation and analysis not only highlight the impact of my research but also provide valuable insights for other researchers in the field.

Given the relevance and connection between our work, I sincerely request your support by writing a recommendation letter for my green card application. Your endorsement would significantly enhance my application and support my professional and personal growth.

Please feel free to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org if you have any questions or require additional information.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
