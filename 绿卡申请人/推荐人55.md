**Subject: Request for a Recommendation Letter**

Dear Dr. Kit K. Elam,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card and am reaching out to seek your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been deeply impressed by your article, "Gene set enrichment analysis to create polygenic scores: a developmental examination of aggression." Your detailed exploration of creating polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to inform selection of SNPs from meta-GWAS data and your examination of developmental trajectories in aggression closely align with my own research interests and work in bioinformatics.

In your article, you cited my work titled "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." Specifically, you referenced my contributions in the development of bioinformatics tools that enhance the identification of biologically relevant gene sets, which is fundamental to the methodology you employed in your study. Your citation of my work highlights the impact and utility of the i-GSEA4GWAS web server in advancing the analysis of genetic data and the creation of functionally informed PRSs.

Given the relevance and connection between our work, I sincerely request your support by writing a recommendation letter for my green card application. Your endorsement would significantly enhance my application and support my professional and personal growth.

Please feel free to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org if you have any questions or require additional information.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
