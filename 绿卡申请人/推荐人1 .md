Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Dr. McPherson,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am reaching out to you with a humble request for a recommendation letter in support of my application for a National Interest Waiver (NIW).

I have long admired your pioneering work in the field of coronary artery disease (CAD) genetics, particularly your insightful publication "Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease." Your research, which highlights the significant contributions of genetic factors to CAD risk and the advancements made through genome-wide association studies, has been instrumental in shaping my understanding and approach to bioinformatics in cardiovascular disease research.

In your article, you detail the identification of numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CAD risk and the development of genetic risk scores that enhance risk prediction beyond conventional factors. This work has been foundational to my research, particularly in developing bioinformatic tools and methods for genetic data analysis.

One of my notable contributions to the field is my publication titled "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." My work on i-GSEA4GWAS complements your findings by providing a robust platform for identifying pathways and gene sets associated with complex traits, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of diseases like CAD.

I am writing to seek your support and endorsement as a recommender for my NIW application. Your esteemed recommendation would be invaluable, given your authority in the field and the relevance of your research to my work. I believe your insights and endorsement could significantly strengthen my application by highlighting the impact of my research on advancing the understanding and treatment of coronary artery disease.

I understand the demands on your time and would be deeply grateful for your consideration of this request. I am happy to provide any additional information or discuss further at your convenience.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Sijia Cui
