Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Flores,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support in my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I am reaching out to you because of your significant contributions to the field of asthma genetics, particularly through your outstanding work on the pathway-based association study revealing variants from Wnt signaling genes contributing to asthma susceptibility. Your paper, "A pathway-based association study reveals variants from Wnt signalling genes contributing to asthma susceptibility," has been particularly impactful to my research.

In your paper, you discuss the identification of significant biological pathways, such as cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and Wnt signaling, using gene-set enrichment analysis based on GWAS summary data for asthma. You further detail the prioritization of genes within these pathways and the subsequent association studies that identified a novel susceptibility locus near the FZD6 gene. Your findings have provided valuable insights into the genetic underpinnings of asthma and highlighted the importance of pathway-based approaches in uncovering novel disease genes.

I am honored that you cited my work, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," in your research. Your paper references my work as a crucial tool in your gene-set enrichment analysis, specifically in identifying significant pathways contributing to asthma susceptibility. This citation underscores the relevance and impact of my contributions to the field and the alignment of our research interests.

Given our shared focus on enhancing the analytical strategies for genomic data and understanding complex genetic relationships, I believe your recommendation would be immensely valuable to my NIW application. Your endorsement would highlight the significance of my research contributions and the potential impact of my work on advancing our understanding of human genetics and complex diseases.

If you are willing to support my application, I would be delighted to provide any additional information or materials you might need. I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am genuinely grateful for your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
