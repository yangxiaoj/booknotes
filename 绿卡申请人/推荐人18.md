Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Fridley,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category, and I am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been greatly inspired by your work, particularly your article titled "Gene set analysis of SNP data: benefits, challenges, and future directions." Your research provides a comprehensive overview of the potential of Gene Set Analysis (GSA) to uncover genetic risk factors for complex traits. The detailed examination of GSA methods, including their benefits and limitations, as well as the challenges inherent in these analyses, has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the field.

In my own research, I have focused on the application of gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). My paper, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," published in 2010, introduced a web server that improves the identification of pathways and gene sets associated with various traits. Specifically, our work highlighted the integration of pathway-based approaches to enhance the discovery of genetic associations in GWAS data. Your discussion on the potential of GSA to detect subtle effects of multiple SNPs within gene sets directly aligns with the principles and objectives of my research.

Given the thematic overlap between our research interests and the significance of your contributions to the field, I believe that your endorsement would be invaluable to my application. Your recognition and validation of my work would greatly strengthen my case for demonstrating the national interest and scientific merit of my contributions.

I would be honored if you could take the time to write a recommendation letter on my behalf. If you are willing, I can provide you with my CV, details of my research, and any additional information you may need to facilitate the writing process.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I truly appreciate your time and support.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
