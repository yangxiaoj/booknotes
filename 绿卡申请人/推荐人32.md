Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Jennifer L. Güler,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to request your support in my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I have been following your groundbreaking work, particularly your article titled "Single-cell sequencing of the small and AT-skewed genome of malaria parasites," which has significantly advanced our understanding of single-cell genomics in Plasmodium falciparum. The innovative single-cell sequencing pipeline you developed to optimize quasi-linear amplification methods and detect minor genetic variants in parasite genomes has been incredibly inspiring. Your work in this field is highly relevant to my research interests and efforts in bioinformatics and single-cell analysis.

As a fellow researcher who has made substantial contributions to the field, I have also published work that might interest you. Specifically, my research on "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing" aligns closely with your work on genetic variation detection and single-cell sequencing. In this study, I utilized advanced single-cell sequencing techniques to uncover the clonal evolution patterns in hepatocellular carcinoma, which has provided new insights into cancer genomics and therapeutic strategies.

Given the synergy between our research areas and your esteemed position in the field, I believe your recommendation would be invaluable to my green card application. Your endorsement would significantly strengthen my case by highlighting the relevance and impact of my work within the broader scientific community.

I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am more than willing to provide any additional information or materials you might need to facilitate this process. If you agree to support my application, I would be happy to provide a draft letter for your review and modification.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of having your esteemed support in my application.

Warmest regards,
