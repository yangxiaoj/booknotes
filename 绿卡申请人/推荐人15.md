Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Mr. Jeroen Dekervel,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support by providing a recommendation letter for my green card application under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

Your article, "Applications of Single-Cell Multi-Omics in Liver Cancer," has been profoundly influential in my research. I greatly admire your comprehensive analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly your insights into the clinical, biological, and molecular heterogeneity of this disease. The emphasis on the potential of single-cell multi-omics to revolutionize individualized care for HCC patients is especially relevant to my work.

In my recent study, titled "Diverse Modes of Clonal Evolution in HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Revealed by Single-Cell Genome Sequencing," I explored the clonal evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). My research complements your findings by providing a single-cell perspective on how HBV impacts clonal diversification and tumor progression. Specifically, I have investigated the early driver events of HBV integration and how they influence the clonal dynamics within tumors. Your article's discussion on the heterogeneity in cancer, stromal, and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment aligns closely with my focus on clonal evolution and tumor heterogeneity.

Given the significant impact of your work on my research, I believe your recommendation would greatly strengthen my NIW application. Your esteemed position and expertise in this field would provide a compelling endorsement of my contributions and potential for continued impactful research in bioinformatics and cancer genomics.

I would be honored if you could support my application by writing a recommendation letter that highlights the relevance and importance of my research, as well as my potential to contribute to the scientific community in the United States. I am happy to provide any additional information or discuss this further at your convenience.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of your support in this important step of my career.

Best regards,
