**Figure Results**:
The analysis reveals that B cells do not show significant differences in proportions among HCC, benign, and healthy tissues. CD4 T cells are significantly more abundant in HCC compared to healthy controls (P < 0.01), and similarly, CD4 T cells are significantly elevated in benign tissues compared to healthy controls (P < 0.01). However, the difference in CD4 T cell proportions between HCC and benign tissues is not statistically significant.

CD8 T cells are significantly more prevalent in healthy tissues than in HCC (P < 0.01), and benign tissues also show a significantly higher proportion of CD8 T cells compared to HCC (P < 0.01). Additionally, the proportion of CD8 T cells in healthy tissues is significantly higher than in benign tissues (P < 0.05).

Myeloid cells are significantly more abundant in HCC compared to both healthy (P < 0.01) and benign tissues (P < 0.01). However, there is no significant difference in Myeloid cell proportions between benign and healthy tissues.

Non-classical T cells (ncT) are significantly more prevalent in healthy tissues compared to both HCC (P < 0.01) and benign tissues (P < 0.01), with a notable difference also observed between healthy and benign tissues (P < 0.05).

Neutrophils are significantly more abundant in healthy tissues compared to HCC (P < 0.01) and benign tissues (P < 0.03), with no significant difference observed between HCC and benign tissues.

Natural Killer (NK) cells are significantly more prevalent in healthy tissues compared to HCC (P < 0.01) and benign tissues (P < 0.03). Additionally, NK cell proportions are significantly higher in benign tissues compared to HCC (P < 0.03). This suggests that NK cell levels are highest in healthy tissues and lowest in HCC.

**Biological Interpretation**:
The observed immune cell distribution patterns suggest a distinct immune landscape in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to benign and healthy tissues. The significant elevation of CD4 T cells in HCC and benign tissues compared to healthy controls may indicate an adaptive immune response, although the lack of difference between HCC and benign tissues suggests similar levels of immune activation in these conditions. The decreased CD8 T cell levels in HCC, coupled with their relative abundance in healthy tissues, could imply impaired cytotoxic immune activity in HCC, which might contribute to tumor immune evasion.

The increased myeloid cell presence in HCC compared to benign and healthy tissues suggests an inflammatory or immunosuppressive microenvironment that might support tumor progression. The reduced levels of non-classical T cells (ncT) in HCC and benign tissues compared to healthy controls may reflect a compromised immune surveillance system in disease states.

Neutrophils, more abundant in healthy tissues, may play a role in maintaining immune homeostasis, with their decreased presence in HCC potentially contributing to an impaired innate immune response. The significant decrease in NK cells in HCC compared to healthy and benign tissues underscores a possible defect in the innate immune surveillance mechanism in HCC, which could facilitate tumor growth and metastasis.

These findings provide critical insights into the immune microenvironment of HCC, potentially offering avenues for targeted immunotherapies and further research into immune modulation in cancer.

1. **图结果**：
分析显示，B细胞在HCC、良性和健康组织之间的比例差异没有显著性。CD4 T细胞在HCC中显著高于健康对照组（P < 0.01），同样地，CD4 T细胞在良性组织中也显著高于健康对照组（P < 0.01）。然而，HCC与良性组织之间的CD4 T细胞比例差异没有统计学意义。

CD8 T细胞在健康组织中的比例显著高于HCC（P < 0.01），并且良性组织中的CD8 T细胞比例也显著高于HCC（P < 0.01）。此外，健康组织中的CD8 T细胞比例显著高于良性组织（P < 0.05）。

髓系细胞在HCC中的比例显著高于健康组织（P < 0.01）和良性组织（P < 0.01）。然而，良性与健康组织之间的髓系细胞比例差异没有显著性。

非经典T细胞（ncT）在健康组织中的比例显著高于HCC（P < 0.01）和良性组织（P < 0.01），且健康与良性组织之间也存在显著差异（P < 0.05）。

中性粒细胞在健康组织中的比例显著高于HCC（P < 0.01）和良性组织（P < 0.03），而HCC与良性组织之间的差异则不显著。

自然杀伤细胞（NK细胞）在健康组织中的比例显著高于HCC（P < 0.01）和良性组织（P < 0.03）。此外，良性组织中的NK细胞比例显著高于HCC（P < 0.03）。这表明NK细胞在健康组织中含量最高，而在HCC中含量最低。

2. **生物学解释**：
观察到的免疫细胞分布模式表明，肝细胞癌（HCC）与良性和健康组织相比，具有独特的免疫微环境。CD4 T细胞在HCC和良性组织中显著升高，这可能表明适应性免疫反应的存在，尽管HCC和良性组织之间无显著差异，暗示这些疾病状态下的免疫激活水平相似。HCC中CD8 T细胞水平的下降，伴随着健康组织中CD8 T细胞的相对丰富，可能表明HCC中细胞毒性免疫活性的受损，这可能有助于肿瘤的免疫逃逸。

HCC中髓系细胞的增加表明，可能存在支持肿瘤进展的炎症或免疫抑制性微环境。HCC和良性组织中非经典T细胞（ncT）水平的减少可能反映出这些疾病状态下免疫监视系统的受损。

中性粒细胞在健康组织中更为丰富，可能在维持免疫稳态中起重要作用，HCC中中性粒细胞的减少可能导致先天免疫反应的受损。HCC中NK细胞显著减少表明其先天免疫监视机制可能存在缺陷，从而促进肿瘤的生长和转移。

这些发现为HCC的免疫微环境提供了重要的见解，可能为靶向免疫治疗和癌症免疫调节的进一步研究提供了新思路。

#### Figure Results:**

The analysis reveals a notable decrease in myeloid cell proportions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples compared to both healthy and benign conditions. Similarly, CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells exhibit significantly reduced proportions in HCC relative to the benign and healthy samples. In contrast, CD4+ T cells are more abundant in HCC than in both benign and healthy conditions, suggesting a distinct immunological shift in the tumor environment.

**3. Biological Meaning of the Figure Results:**

The observed changes in immune cell proportions highlight significant alterations in the tumor microenvironment associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The reduction in myeloid cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells in HCC suggests a compromised immune surveillance and effector function, potentially facilitating tumor progression and immune evasion. Conversely, the increase in CD4+ T cells in HCC may reflect a shift towards a more immunosuppressive or regulatory T cell phenotype, contributing to the tumor's ability to evade the immune response. These findings underscore the complex interplay between different immune cell types in shaping the tumor microenvironment and may inform the development of immunotherapeutic strategies targeting these cellular components.




**2. 图形结果：**

分析显示，肝细胞癌（HCC）样本中髓系细胞比例显著低于健康和良性条件。同样，CD8+ T 细胞和自然杀伤（NK）细胞在 HCC 中的比例显著低于良性和健康样本。相比之下，HCC 中的 CD4+ T 细胞比例高于良性和健康样本，提示肿瘤环境中存在显著的免疫学变化。

**3. 图形结果的生物学意义：**

观察到的免疫细胞比例变化突出了与肝细胞癌相关的肿瘤微环境中显著的变化。髓系细胞、CD8+ T 细胞和 NK 细胞在 HCC 中的减少，提示免疫监视和效应功能受损，可能有助于肿瘤的进展和免疫逃逸。相反，HCC 中 CD4+ T 细胞的增加可能反映了向更具免疫抑制性或调节性 T 细胞表型的转变，促进肿瘤逃避免疫反应。这些发现强调了不同免疫细胞类型之间复杂的相互作用在塑造肿瘤微环境中的作用，并可能为靶向这些细胞成分的免疫治疗策略开发提供参考。

2. **Biological Meaning:**
   The dominance of CD4 T cells suggests a potentially critical role in the immune response within the studied context, as they are key regulators of immune function. The substantial presence of myeloid cells indicates active innate immune responses, potentially involving antigen presentation and inflammation. The presence of CD8 T cells reflects cytotoxic activity, crucial for targeting infected or malignant cells. NK cells, which also have cytotoxic functions, further highlight the importance of immune surveillance in this system. The relatively low proportion of neutrophils might suggest either a less pronounced acute inflammatory response or a specific tissue environment where neutrophil recruitment or survival is limited.

**3. Explanation of the Biological Meaning:**

**The distribution of CD8+ T cell subtypes reflects the immune system's adaptive response. Effector memory CD8+ T cells, which dominate the population, are crucial for rapid response upon re-exposure to antigens, indicating a potentially heightened immune surveillance or a history of antigen exposure. Temra CD8+ T cells, which are terminally differentiated, suggest a transition from memory to a more differentiated state, likely contributing to immediate effector functions. Central memory CD8+ T cells, though less prevalent, are essential for long-term immunity and recall responses. The relatively low proportion of naive CD8+ T cells indicates limited recent recruitment of new, unexposed T cells, which could imply a mature immune response within the analyzed sample.**

The proportion of Myeloid cells was observed in descending order as follows: classical Monocytes, plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs), non-classical Monocytes, conventional Dendritic Cells (cDCs), and HLA-DR-low Monocytes.

**3. Explanation of the Biological Meaning:**

The results highlight the varying abundance of different Myeloid cell types within the studied sample. Classical Monocytes, which are the most abundant, play a crucial role in innate immunity and inflammation. Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDCs), although less abundant, are essential for antiviral responses due to their ability to produce large amounts of interferon-alpha. Non-classical Monocytes, which follow in abundance, are involved in patrolling vascular tissues and have roles in tissue repair and homeostasis. Conventional Dendritic Cells (cDCs) are key antigen-presenting cells that initiate adaptive immune responses, while HLA-DR-low Monocytes, which are the least abundant, may represent a subset with reduced antigen-presenting capability, potentially linked to immunosuppressive functions. This distribution provides insights into the immune landscape and potential functional implications in the context of the biological system under study.

RESULTS OUTPUT:



2. **Figure Results**:
The proportions of NK cells are displayed in descending order: Immature NK cells, Mature CD57+ NK cells, and Mature CD16+ NK cells.

3. **Biological Meaning**:
The figure demonstrates a hierarchical differentiation of NK cells, beginning with a higher proportion of immature NK cells, followed by a decline as they mature. The transition from immature NK cells to mature CD57+ and CD16+ NK cells suggests a progressive development and functional specialization of NK cells. This pattern reflects the natural progression of NK cell maturation, where immature NK cells are more abundant, gradually maturing into specialized subtypes with distinct functional roles in immune surveillance and response. The variation in proportions could indicate the dynamic balance between different stages of NK cell development and their respective roles in the immune system.

Cell Proportion Volcano Plot (HCC vs Benign)


**Description**:
   The Cell Proportion Volcano Plot provides a comparative analysis of immune cell subsets between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and benign liver tissues. This visualization highlights significant differences in the relative abundance of specific immune cell types, offering insights into the immune landscape of HCC.

###  Results

In HCC high proportion:classical Monocytes,
pDCs,HLA-DR-low Monocytes and non-classical Monocytes.

In Benign high proportion：CD8 TEMRA，CD4 central memory，
Switched memory B cells，Naive GD8 T cells and gdT cells.



### CHATGPT  RESULTS OUTPUT



2. **Figure Results**:
   The analysis reveals that in HCC, there is a higher proportion of classical monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), HLA-DR-low monocytes, and non-classical monocytes. Conversely, benign liver tissues show a higher proportion of CD8 TEMRA cells, CD4 central memory T cells, switched memory B cells, naive CD8 T cells, and γδ T cells.

3. **Biological Meaning**:
   The observed immune cell profile suggests distinct immunological environments between hepatocellular carcinoma and benign liver tissues. The enrichment of monocytes and pDCs in HCC may indicate an inflammatory or immunosuppressive milieu, which could contribute to tumor progression and immune evasion. On the other hand, the higher proportions of memory T cells and specific B cell subsets in benign tissues suggest a more robust and possibly protective immune surveillance mechanism, maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing malignancy. This differential immune landscape highlights potential targets for immunotherapeutic strategies in HCC.

RESULTS OUTPUT


1. **图形结果**：
   分析显示，在HCC中，经典单核细胞、浆细胞样树突状细胞（pDCs）、HLA-DR低表达单核细胞和非经典单核细胞的比例较高。相反，在良性肝组织中，CD8 TEMRA细胞、CD4中心记忆T细胞、切换记忆B细胞、初始CD8 T细胞和γδ T细胞的比例较高。

2. **生物学意义**：
   观察到的免疫细胞谱系表明肝细胞癌与良性肝组织之间存在不同的免疫环境。HCC中单核细胞和pDCs的富集可能表明存在炎症或免疫抑制环境，这可能促进肿瘤进展和免疫逃逸。另一方面，良性组织中较高比例的记忆T细胞和特定B细胞亚群可能表明更强大的、可能具有保护作用的免疫监视机制，维持组织稳态并防止恶性肿瘤的发生。这种差异化的免疫景观突出了HCC免疫治疗潜在的靶点。

RESULTS OUTPUT:



**2. Figure Results:**
In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, a higher proportion of CD4 effector memory T cells, classical monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and non-classical monocytes was observed. Conversely, healthy controls exhibited a higher proportion of mature CD16+ NK cells, switched memory B cells, immature NK cells, CD8 TEMRA cells, naive CD8 T cells, gamma-delta T cells, CD4 central memory T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and CD8 effector memory T cells.

**3. Biological Meaning:**
The observed differences in immune cell proportions between HCC patients and healthy controls suggest a reprogramming of the immune environment in the context of cancer. The increased presence of CD4 effector memory T cells and monocyte subsets in HCC may indicate a heightened inflammatory or immune-suppressive response, potentially contributing to tumor progression and immune evasion. On the other hand, the higher abundance of various NK cells, memory B cells, and other T cell subsets in healthy individuals highlights a more balanced and potentially effective immune surveillance mechanism that may be compromised in HCC. These findings underscore the complexity of the immune landscape in HCC and its potential implications for disease progression and therapeutic strategies.



**2. 图表结果:**
在肝细胞癌（HCC）患者中，观察到CD4效应记忆T细胞、经典单核细胞、浆细胞样树突状细胞（pDCs）和非经典单核细胞的比例较高。相反，健康对照组中成熟的CD16+自然杀伤（NK）细胞、转换记忆B细胞、未成熟NK细胞、CD8 TEMRA细胞、初始CD8 T细胞、γδ T细胞、CD4中央记忆T细胞、粘膜相关不变T细胞（MAIT）和CD8效应记忆T细胞的比例较高。

**3. 生物学意义:**
HCC患者与健康对照组之间免疫细胞比例的差异表明了癌症背景下免疫环境的重编程。HCC中CD4效应记忆T细胞和单核细胞亚群的增加可能表明存在增强的炎症或免疫抑制反应，这可能促进肿瘤进展和免疫逃逸。另一方面，健康个体中各种NK细胞、记忆B细胞及其他T细胞亚群的丰富性则突显出一种更为平衡且可能更有效的免疫监视机制，而这种机制可能在HCC中受到削弱。这些发现强调了HCC中免疫景观的复杂性及其对疾病进展和治疗策略的潜在影响。


## Benign HBV


![](images/2024-08-11-13-00-47.png)


### Description


In the Benign group, we performed a comparative analysis of various cell types between patients with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and those without HBV infection. 

###  Results



MAIT cells,Mature CD57+ NK cells,Immture NK cells and CD8 effector momory ,these cell types in HBV is significantly higher than in non-HBV patient;while non-classical Monocytes in HBV is significantly lower than in non-HBV.



RESULTS OUTPUT:



1. **Figure Results:**

We observed that the frequencies of MAIT cells, mature CD57+ NK cells, immature NK cells, and CD8 effector memory cells were significantly elevated in HBV patients compared to non-HBV patients. In contrast, the frequency of non-classical monocytes was significantly reduced in HBV patients relative to non-HBV patients.

3. **Biological Meaning:**

The observed increase in MAIT cells, mature CD57+ NK cells, immature NK cells, and CD8 effector memory cells in HBV patients suggests a heightened immune activation and cytotoxic response in the presence of HBV infection. These cell types are involved in antiviral defense, indicating that the immune system is likely responding robustly to HBV. On the other hand, the decreased frequency of non-classical monocytes in HBV patients may indicate a suppression or exhaustion of this cell subset, which is typically involved in immune surveillance and inflammation. This alteration could reflect a specific immune modulation by HBV that favors the persistence of the virus within the host.


RESULTS OUTPUT:


1. **图表结果:**

我们发现，与非HBV患者相比，HBV患者的MAIT细胞、成熟的CD57+ NK细胞、未成熟NK细胞和CD8效应记忆细胞的频率显著升高。相反，HBV患者的非经典单核细胞频率显著降低。

3. **生物学意义:**

在HBV患者中观察到的MAIT细胞、成熟的CD57+ NK细胞、未成熟NK细胞和CD8效应记忆细胞的增加表明，在HBV感染的情况下，免疫激活和细胞毒性反应有所增强。这些细胞类型参与抗病毒防御，表明免疫系统可能正在对HBV作出强烈反应。另一方面，HBV患者中非经典单核细胞频率的降低可能表明这一细胞亚群的抑制或耗竭，而这些细胞通常参与免疫监视和炎症。这种变化可能反映了HBV特定的免疫调节机制，有利于病毒在宿主体内的持久存在。

### Results


CD4 Memory Treg cells,gDT, Naive B cells, Neutrophils and unswitched momory B cells, these cell types in HBV group is significantly higher than in non-HBV;While immature NK cells and Classical Monocytes in HBV is significantly lower than in non-HBV.




### CHATGPT



RESULTS OUTPUT:



1. **Figure Results:**
   The analysis revealed that the levels of CD4 Memory Treg cells, γδ T cells, Naive B cells, Neutrophils, and Unswitched Memory B cells were significantly higher in the HBV-infected group compared to the non-HBV group. In contrast, the levels of Immature NK cells and Classical Monocytes were significantly lower in the HBV-infected group.

2. **Biological Meaning of the Figure Results:**
   The observed differences in cell type distribution between HBV-infected and non-HBV individuals suggest a distinct immune landscape associated with HBV infection. Elevated levels of CD4 Memory Treg cells and γδ T cells in HBV-infected patients may indicate a regulatory and adaptive immune response to persistent viral infection. The increase in Naive B cells, Neutrophils, and Unswitched Memory B cells could reflect an ongoing immune activation and inflammatory state. Conversely, the reduced levels of Immature NK cells and Classical Monocytes may imply a compromised innate immune response, potentially contributing to the chronicity and immune evasion observed in HBV infection. These findings underscore the complexity of the immune response in HBV-associated HCC and may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets.

RESULTS OUTPUT:



1. **图表结果:**
   分析结果显示，HBV感染组中，CD4记忆T调节细胞、γδ T细胞、初始B细胞、中性粒细胞和未转换的记忆B细胞的水平显著高于非HBV组。相比之下，HBV感染组中的未成熟NK细胞和经典单核细胞的水平显著低于非HBV组。

2. **图表结果的生物学意义:**
   在HBV感染者与非感染者之间观察到的细胞类型分布差异表明HBV感染相关的独特免疫景观。HBV感染患者中CD4记忆T调节细胞和γδ T细胞的升高可能表明对持续性病毒感染的调节性和适应性免疫反应。初始B细胞、中性粒细胞和未转换的记忆B细胞的增加可能反映了持续的免疫激活和炎症状态。相反，未成熟NK细胞和经典单核细胞水平的下降可能暗示先天免疫反应受损，可能导致HBV感染的慢性化和免疫逃逸。这些发现突显了HBV相关HCC中免疫反应的复杂性，并可能为潜在的治疗靶点提供见解。
