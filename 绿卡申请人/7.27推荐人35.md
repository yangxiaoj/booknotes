Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Andrew W. Duncan,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been greatly impressed by your work, particularly your article titled "Single-Cell DNA Sequencing Reveals Chromosomal Diversity in HCC and a Novel Model of HCC Evolution." Your detailed analysis of chromosome copy number alterations (CNAs) and their role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) heterogeneity has been a significant source of inspiration for my research. Your findings on the dual-phase copy number evolution model (DPCNE) and its implications for understanding HCC progression and prognosis are groundbreaking.

I would be honored if you could reference my work in your letter. My recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," intersects with your research in terms of utilizing single-cell sequencing to reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify potential disease biomarkers. Specifically, your study's discussion on the diverse chromosomal alterations in HCC and their evolutionary mechanisms aligns closely with my findings on clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. My work further supports the idea that single-cell genome sequencing can uncover intricate details of tumor evolution and heterogeneity that are not apparent in bulk sequencing.

A recommendation from a distinguished researcher such as yourself, who has significantly contributed to the field of cancer genomics and single-cell analysis, would be invaluable to my application. Your endorsement would not only attest to my expertise and contributions to the field but also underscore the broader impact of my research.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I greatly appreciate any time you can spare to assist me in this important step of my career. If you need any additional information or context for the letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
