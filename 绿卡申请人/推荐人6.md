Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Dr. Augusto Villanueva,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to you to seek your support and request you to be a referee for my green card application under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I have been deeply inspired by your work, particularly your research on "Tumour evolution in hepatocellular carcinoma". Your insights into the molecular heterogeneity and clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have been groundbreaking and have significantly influenced the field. The comprehensive analysis of clonal selection, neutral evolution, and the role of the tumor microenvironment in HCC is particularly relevant to my work.

In my research, I have focused on studying the clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma using single-cell genome sequencing. My paper, titled "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing", has delved into the intricate dynamics of tumor progression and has built upon the foundational concepts that you have so expertly elucidated. Specifically, my work has further explored the genomic instability and APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, elements that are critical in understanding the evolution of HCC.

Given our overlapping research interests and the influence of your work on my own research, I believe your endorsement would greatly strengthen my application. Your recognition of my contributions to the field of bioinformatics and cancer research would be invaluable.

I understand that your schedule is incredibly demanding, and I sincerely appreciate your consideration of my request. If you are willing to support my application, I can provide any additional information or documentation you may need.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
