**Subject: Request for a Recommendation Letter**

Dear Dr. Birgit Debrabant,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am reaching out to you with a request for your support in the form of a recommendation letter for my green card application.

I have been greatly inspired by your work, particularly your article titled "The null hypothesis of GSEA, and a novel statistical model for competitive gene set analysis." Your innovative approach to competitive gene set analysis and the development of a hierarchical statistical model have provided significant insights into the field.

In your article, you referenced my work, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." Specifically, you highlighted how my contributions to enhancing the identification of biologically relevant gene sets informed your methodology, especially in the context of understanding the competitive null hypothesis and the practical applications of GSEA.

Given the relevance and connection between our research, I would be honored if you could write a recommendation letter for my green card application. Your endorsement would greatly strengthen my application and support my professional and personal growth in the United States.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there is anything I can provide to facilitate this request. I truly appreciate your consideration and time.

Thank you very much for your support.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
