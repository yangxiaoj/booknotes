Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Reema Singh,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been deeply inspired by your article titled "Single-Cell Sequencing in Human Genital Infections." Your comprehensive review on the applications of single-cell sequencing technologies in studying human genital infections has significantly influenced my own research. The way you have highlighted the potential of these technologies to uncover drug-resistant clones, transcriptional diversity, and rare cell types in pathogen populations has provided valuable insights into the power of single-cell approaches in understanding complex biological systems.

I would be honored if you could reference my work in your letter. My recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," intersects with your research in exploring the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. Specifically, your focus on single-cell sequencing to understand pathogen diversity aligns closely with my findings on the clonal evolution and genomic diversity in HBV-related HCC. My work further elucidates how single-cell genome sequencing can reveal the intricate details of tumor heterogeneity and the mechanisms driving malignant transformation.

A recommendation from a distinguished researcher such as yourself, who has significantly contributed to the field of genomic research, would be invaluable to my application. Your endorsement would not only attest to my expertise and contributions to the field but also underscore the broader impact of my research on understanding disease pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic strategies.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I greatly appreciate any time you can spare to assist me in this important step of my career. If you need any additional information or context for the letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
