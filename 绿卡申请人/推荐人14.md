Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Adugna,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to ask if you would be willing to provide a recommendation letter in support of my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I have been deeply inspired by your groundbreaking work in the field of liver cancer research, particularly your article titled "Histomolecular Characterisation of Hepatitis B Virus Induced Liver Cancer." Your comprehensive analysis of the histomolecular mechanisms, including epigenetics, genomics, proteomics, glycoproteomics, metabolomics, exosomes, and autophagy, has significantly advanced our understanding of HBV-induced liver cancer. Your insights into how HBV integration into the host genome and the resulting genomic instability contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis have been particularly influential in my own research.

In my recent study, titled "Diverse Modes of Clonal Evolution in HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Revealed by Single-Cell Genome Sequencing," I explored the clonal evolution and intratumoral heterogeneity in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). My work complements your findings by providing a single-cell perspective on how HBV impacts clonal diversification and tumor progression. Specifically, I have investigated the early driver events of HBV integration and how they influence the clonal dynamics within tumors. Your article's discussion on the integration of viral genetic material into the human genome and its impact on cancer-related genes directly relates to the focus of my study.

Given the alignment of our research interests and the significant influence of your work on my own studies, I believe your recommendation would greatly strengthen my NIW application. Your esteemed position and expertise in this field would provide a compelling endorsement of my contributions and potential for continued impactful research in bioinformatics and cancer genomics.

I would be honored if you could support my application by writing a recommendation letter that highlights the relevance and importance of my research, as well as my potential to contribute to the scientific community in the United States. I am happy to provide any additional information or discuss this further at your convenience.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of your support in this important step of my career.

Best regards,
