### Figure Description

A volcano plot displaying the comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between {groupA} and {groupB}. The analysis utilized a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test to identify significant differences. Genes are marked as regulated based on a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of less than 0.05, along with a fold change (FC) greater than 1.2 or less than -1.2.
