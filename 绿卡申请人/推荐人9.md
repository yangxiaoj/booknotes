Subject: Request for Recommendation for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Fortina,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a National Interest Waiver (NIW) for my green card, and I am writing to kindly request your support as a recommendation letter writer for my application.

Your significant contributions to the field of hepatitis research, particularly your paper titled "Evidence for Benefits of Early Treatment Initiation for Chronic Hepatitis B," have been a great inspiration to me. The insights and findings in your study have not only advanced our understanding of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but have also underscored the critical importance of early antiviral treatment initiation. Your work has provided valuable data on disease progression, risk of HCC, and the economic impact of early treatment, which aligns closely with my research interests and contributions.

In my own research, specifically in my paper titled "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," I have explored the clonal evolution in HBV-related HCC using advanced single-cell genome sequencing techniques. The data and insights from your work on the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis and the impact of antiviral treatment on HBV DNA integration have been pivotal in shaping my research direction and understanding of the disease.

Given your esteemed position in the field and the relevance of our research areas, I believe your recommendation would add substantial weight to my application. Your endorsement would greatly support my case by highlighting the importance and impact of my work in advancing the understanding and treatment of HBV-related diseases.

I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am more than willing to provide any additional information or materials you may need to facilitate this process. I truly appreciate your consideration of my request and your potential support in my NIW application.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
