### Figure Description

A volcano plot displaying the comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between {groupA} and {groupB}. The analysis utilized a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test to identify significant differences. Genes are marked as regulated based on a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of less than 0.05, along with a fold change (FC) greater than 1.2 or less than -1.2.

### Figure Description

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) visualizations delineate the distinct subpopulations within T cells, including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and gamma delta (γδ) T cells.






### Figure Results 

Results:

Through our comprehensive multi-omic analysis focusing on the single-cell architecture of late-relapsed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified significant heterogeneity within the immune cell populations. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data revealed distinct subpopulations among T cells, characterized as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and gamma delta (γδ) T cells, across both primary and late-relapsed HCC samples. Similarly, the single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) data provided insights into the chromatin accessibility landscape, underscoring the epigenetic variations that accompany the transcriptional diversity observed in T cell subpopulations. Notably, the late-relapsed HCC samples exhibited a unique immune cell composition and activation state, suggesting an adapted immune microenvironment in response to the recurrent tumor challenge.


Biological Explanation:

The distinct subpopulations of T cells identified in late-relapsed HCC samples highlight the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and its evolution over time. CD4+ T cells, known for their helper functions, and CD8+ T cells, recognized for their cytotoxic activities, along with γδ T cells, which play roles in both innate and adaptive immunity, exhibit specific transcriptional and epigenetic profiles suggesting their unique roles in the immune response to late-relapsed HCC. The observed heterogeneity implies a nuanced immune landscape that evolves in response to the tumor's recurrence, potentially influenced by previous treatments and the tumor's acquired mutations. This adaptation might reflect the immune system's attempt to control tumor growth, despite the challenges of overcoming immune evasion tactics developed by the tumor. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies targeting the immune system's interaction with late-relapsed HCC, highlighting the importance of personalized medicine approaches in treating complex cancers.


### Figure Methods 


"To investigate the diversity and distribution of T cell subpopulations within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we employed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and visualization. This analysis facilitated the identification and representation of distinct T cell subsets, specifically CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and gamma delta (γδ) T cells, across the collected HCC samples. UMAP plots were generated to illustrate the intricate patterns of these subpopulations, offering insights into their spatial distribution and relative abundance."
