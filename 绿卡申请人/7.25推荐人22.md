### Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Professor Chen,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) program, which requires me to gather letters of recommendation from esteemed colleagues and experts in my field. Given your profound contributions to cancer research and your remarkable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), I am writing to ask if you would be willing to write a recommendation letter for me.

Your paper, "Exploring cell competition for the prevention and therapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma," has greatly influenced my work, especially in understanding the dynamics of cancer cell competition and the therapeutic potential of targeting these mechanisms. I am particularly impressed by your discussion on the interplay between NRF2, NOTCH pathway, and TP53 in ESCC, which has provided a significant foundation for my research.

In my recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," I explored the clonal evolution and heterogeneity of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Your work on ESCC has been pivotal in shaping my understanding of clonal dynamics and competitive interactions among cancer cells. Specifically, I cited your findings on the competitive fitness of mutant clones and the potential therapeutic implications in the discussion section of my paper.

I believe your recommendation would greatly strengthen my application, highlighting the relevance and impact of my research in the broader context of cancer biology and therapy. Your support would be invaluable in demonstrating my contributions to the field and my potential for future advancements.

If you are willing to assist me, I would be happy to provide any additional information or materials you might need. Please feel free to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of your support.

Warm regards,
