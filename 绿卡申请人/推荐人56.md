**Subject: Request for a Recommendation Letter**

Dear Dr. Jane Shearer,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card and am reaching out to seek your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been deeply impressed by your article, "Dose-Responsive Effects of Iron Supplementation on the Gut Microbiota in Middle-Aged Women." Your detailed investigation into the associations between iron supplementation and gut microbiota in middle-aged women is both insightful and highly relevant to my own research in bioinformatics.

In your article, you cited my work titled "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." Specifically, you referenced my contributions to developing bioinformatics tools that enhance the identification of biologically relevant gene sets. This reference is essential for the methodology you employed in your study, particularly in understanding the microbial functional profiles and the dose-response relationship of iron supplementation.

Given the relevance and connection between our work, I sincerely request your support by writing a recommendation letter for my green card application. Your endorsement would significantly enhance my application and support my professional and personal growth.

Please feel free to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org if you have any questions or require additional information.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
