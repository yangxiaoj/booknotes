Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Jian Zhou,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to kindly request your support in writing a recommendation letter for my green card application.

Over the years, I have had the privilege of following your remarkable work, particularly your recent publication titled "Targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma." Your comprehensive review of the advancements in targeted therapies for HCC has been instrumental in shaping the current understanding and treatment approaches for this disease.

In your article, you thoroughly discussed the critical role of systemic therapy for patients with intermediate and advanced-stage HCC and the promising potential of combination therapies, including anti-angiogenesis agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Your insights into the mechanisms of drug resistance and the exploration of novel therapeutic agents have provided a solid foundation for ongoing clinical trials aimed at improving patient outcomes.

Additionally, I would like to draw your attention to my recent work, which has been cited in your review. In the "Introduction" section of your article, you referenced my research on the diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing. My study provided valuable insights into the genetic and molecular profiles of HCC, contributing to the evolution of strategies for prevention, surveillance, early diagnosis, and treatment of this malignancy.

Given the alignment of our research interests and the recognition of my contributions in your work, I would be deeply honored if you could write a recommendation letter for my green card application. Your endorsement would be invaluable in demonstrating the significance of my research and its impact on the field of hepatocellular carcinoma.

If you agree to this request, I would be happy to provide any additional information or materials that may assist you in writing the letter. I am also available for a brief meeting or call at your convenience to discuss this further.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I greatly appreciate your time and support.

Warm regards,

Sijia Cui
