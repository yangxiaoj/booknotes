Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Mr. James C Costello ,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to you with a humble request for a recommendation letter in support of my application for a National Interest Waiver (NIW).

I have greatly admired your pioneering work in the field of gene set enrichment analysis, particularly your insightful publication "GSEA-InContext: identifying novel and common patterns in expression experiments." Your research, which enhances the traditional Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) by placing single experiments into the context of relevant background experiments, has significantly influenced my approach to bioinformatics analysis.

In your article, you detail how the GSEA-InContext method accounts for gene expression patterns within a background set of experiments to identify statistically significantly enriched gene sets, providing valuable insights that complement standard GSEA analysis. This approach aligns closely with my own research interests and methodologies.

One of my notable contributions to the field is my publication titled "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." My work on i-GSEA4GWAS complements your findings by offering a robust platform for identifying pathways and gene sets associated with complex traits, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture of diseases. Specifically, in your publication, the introduction and implementation sections highlight the significance of context-specific patterns in GSEA, which directly aligns with the improvements and applications presented in my i-GSEA4GWAS work.

I am writing to seek your support and endorsement as a recommender for my NIW application. Your esteemed recommendation would be invaluable, given your authority in the field and the relevance of your research to my work. I believe your insights and endorsement could significantly strengthen my application by highlighting the impact of my research on advancing the understanding and treatment of complex diseases.

I understand the demands on your time and would be deeply grateful for your consideration of this request. I am happy to provide any additional information or discuss further at your convenience.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Sijia Cui
