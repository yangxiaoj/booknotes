Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Roesel,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card through the National Interest Waiver (NIW) and am reaching out to seek your support in this endeavor.

Given your esteemed work in the field of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), particularly your recent article titled "The Potential of Intertwining Gene Diagnostics and Surgery for Mitral Valve Prolapse," I believe your endorsement would significantly strengthen my application. Your research has profoundly impacted the understanding of the genetic underpinnings of MVP, highlighting the role of next-generation gene sequencing in identifying genetic predispositions and informing surgical interventions.

In your article, you discuss various genes associated with MVP, including DZIP1, TNS1, LMCD1, GLIS1, PTPRJ, FLYWCH, and MMP2. Your work underscores the importance of genetic screening for early diagnosis and preventive strategies, a concept closely aligned with my research on gene signatures in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Specifically, your reference to the identification of pathways and gene sets associated with disease traits parallels the methodologies employed in my study "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study."

In your article, you cite my work in the context of pathway and gene set enrichment analyses, which has been instrumental in advancing the genetic understanding of complex diseases. This citation underscores the synergy between our research efforts and highlights the relevance of my contributions to the broader field of genetic diagnostics and disease prevention.

Given our shared commitment to leveraging genetic insights for improved patient outcomes, I am honored to request your support as a recommender for my NIW application. Your endorsement would provide a strong testament to my contributions to the field and my potential to continue making significant advancements in bioinformatics and genetic research.

I would be happy to provide any additional information or discuss this request further at your convenience. Thank you very much for considering my request. I deeply appreciate your time and support.
