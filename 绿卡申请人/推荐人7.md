Subject: Request for a Letter of Recommendation

Dear Dr. Powell,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am currently in the process of applying for a National Interest Waiver (NIW) and am reaching out to request your support as a reference for my application.

I have long admired your work, particularly your article "Transitioning single-cell genomics into the clinic," which I found incredibly insightful and directly relevant to my research interests and contributions. Your discussion on the clinical applications of single-cell technologies and their potential to uncover genomic variations at the cellular level resonates deeply with my work on the clonal evolution in hepatocellular carcinoma.

In my recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," we explored the genomic heterogeneity and clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma using single-cell sequencing. This study highlighted the importance of single-cell technologies in understanding the complexity and diversity of tumor cell populations, which aligns with the perspectives you have discussed in your article.

Given your esteemed position and expertise in the field of single-cell genomics, your endorsement would significantly strengthen my application. I believe that your perspective on my work would provide valuable insights to the review committee.

I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I greatly appreciate any time you could spare to assist me with this. If you are willing to support my application, I can provide any additional information you might need, including a draft letter or specific points to highlight.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of your support.

Best regards,
