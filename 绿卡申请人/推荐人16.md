Subject: Request for Recommendation for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Fraley,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category, and I am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been greatly inspired by your work, particularly your article titled "Phenotypically supervised single-cell sequencing parses within-cell-type heterogeneity," published in 2021. The insights provided by your research on phenotypically supervised scRNAseq have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of cellular communication and heterogeneity, especially in the context of breast cancer. Your innovative approach to linking phenotypic heterogeneity to transcriptomic data has set a new standard in the field.

In my own research, I have focused on the genetic and transcriptomic diversity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). My paper, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," published in 2018, has explored the clonal evolution in HBV-related HCC using single-cell sequencing technologies. Specifically, our work highlighted the complex clonal structures and evolutionary dynamics of HCC, providing a deeper understanding of tumor heterogeneity and resistance mechanisms.

Given the thematic overlap between our research interests and the significance of your contributions to the field, I believe that your endorsement would be invaluable to my application. Your recognition and validation of my work would greatly strengthen my case for demonstrating the national interest and scientific merit of my contributions.

I would be honored if you could take the time to write a recommendation letter on my behalf. If you are willing, I can provide you with my CV, details of my research, and any additional information you may need to facilitate the writing process.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I truly appreciate your time and support.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
