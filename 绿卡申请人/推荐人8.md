### Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Professor Kennedy,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a National Interest Waiver (NIW) to obtain a green card in the United States, and I am seeking esteemed professionals in my field who can support my application with a recommendation letter. Given your significant contributions to the field of hepatitis research, I am writing to ask if you would be willing to write a letter of recommendation for me.

I have been greatly inspired by your work, particularly your article titled "Evidence for Benefits of Early Treatment Initiation for Chronic Hepatitis B." Your thorough examination of the potential benefits of early antiviral treatment and its economic impact has provided invaluable insights into the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Specifically, your discussion on the reduction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk through early treatment initiation aligns closely with my research interests.

In my own research, I have explored the diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma, which I detailed in my article "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing." My work has demonstrated how HBV DNA integration can drive clonal expansion of hepatocytes, leading to HCC. This research complements your findings by providing a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind HCC development in CHB patients, further supporting the rationale for early treatment initiation.

Your endorsement of my application would be incredibly valuable, highlighting the significance of our complementary research in advancing the understanding and management of CHB and HCC. If you are willing to assist me in this endeavor, I can provide further details about my research and achievements to aid in the preparation of the letter.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that your schedule is very demanding, and I truly appreciate any time you can spare to support my application. Please feel free to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org if you have any questions or require additional information.

Best regards,
