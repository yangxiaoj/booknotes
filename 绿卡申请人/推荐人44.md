Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Bouatia-Naji,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support in my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I am reaching out to you because of your significant contributions to the field of genetics, particularly through your outstanding work on the genetics of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Your paper, "Genome-Wide Association Study–Driven Gene-Set Analyses, Genetic, and Functional Follow-Up Suggest GLIS1 as a Susceptibility Gene for Mitral Valve Prolapse," has been particularly impactful to my research.

In your paper, you applied i-GSEA4GWAS and DEPICT pathway enrichment tools to MVP genome-wide association studies, highlighting the biological mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility to MVP. Your research demonstrates that genes at risk loci are involved in critical biological functions related to actin filament organization, cytoskeleton biology, and cardiac development. The identification of GLIS1 as a susceptibility gene for MVP is a remarkable advancement in our understanding of the disease.

I am honored that you cited my work, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," in your research. Your paper references my work as a crucial tool in your pathway enrichment analysis, specifically in identifying significant pathways for MVP. This citation underscores the relevance and impact of my contributions to the field and the alignment of our research interests.

Given our shared focus on understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases, I believe your recommendation would be immensely valuable to my NIW application. Your endorsement would highlight the significance of my research contributions and the potential impact of my work on advancing our understanding of human genetics and disease mechanisms.

If you are willing to support my application, I would be delighted to provide any additional information or materials you might need. I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am genuinely grateful for your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
