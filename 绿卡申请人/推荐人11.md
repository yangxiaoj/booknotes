Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Professor Sheik Aliya,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am reaching out to request your support in writing a recommendation letter for my green card application.

I have been deeply impressed by your work on "An Overview on Single-Cell Technology for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Diagnosis." Your insights into the application of single-cell technology to understand tumor heterogeneity and improve the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma have been groundbreaking. In particular, your detailed analysis of single-cell transcriptomics and its application in identifying and assessing rare cell populations has greatly influenced my own research.

In my recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," I have cited your work to highlight the advancements in single-cell technology and its implications for understanding the clonal evolution of cancer. Specifically, I referenced your discussion on the limitations of traditional sequencing techniques in identifying rare cell populations and how single-cell RNA sequencing provides a more detailed understanding of tumor heterogeneity. Your pioneering work has provided a foundation for my research, and I believe your recommendation would be invaluable for my application.

I would be deeply honored if you could support my green card application by writing a recommendation letter. Your endorsement would significantly strengthen my case, demonstrating the impact and relevance of my research in the field of bioinformatics and cancer genomics.

If you agree, I can provide further details and any necessary documents to assist you in writing the letter. Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,

Sijia Cui
