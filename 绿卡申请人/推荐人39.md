**Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application**

Dear Dr. Samarendra Das,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been deeply inspired by your article titled "Fifteen Years of Gene Set Analysis for High-Throughput Genomic Data: A Review of Statistical Approaches and Future Challenges." Your comprehensive review of gene set analysis (GSA) approaches and their application in high-throughput genomic studies has significantly influenced my own research. The way you have outlined the evolution, methodologies, and future challenges of GSA has provided invaluable insights into the statistical and biological complexities of analyzing genomic data.

I would be honored if you could reference my work in your letter. My recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," intersects with your research by exploring the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. Specifically, your focus on GSA approaches for high-throughput data aligns closely with my findings on the clonal evolution and genomic diversity in HBV-related HCC. In your article, you emphasize the importance of comprehensive and accurate gene set analysis to understand complex biological systems, a principle that is central to my work on single-cell genome sequencing.

A recommendation from a distinguished researcher such as yourself, who has significantly contributed to the field of genomic research, would be invaluable to my application. Your endorsement would not only attest to my expertise and contributions to the field but also underscore the broader impact of my research on understanding disease pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic strategies.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I greatly appreciate any time you can spare to assist me in this important step of my career. If you need any additional information or context for the letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
