Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Bouchard,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support in my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I am reaching out to you because of your significant contributions to the field of cardiorespiratory fitness genetics, particularly through your outstanding work on exploring the underlying biology of intrinsic cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Your paper, "Exploring the underlying biology of intrinsic cardiorespiratory fitness through integrative analysis of genomic variants and muscle gene expression profiling," has been particularly impactful on my research.

In your paper, you discuss the variability in intrinsic CRF among sedentary adults and explore the genetic and molecular mechanisms influencing this variability. Through a combined analytic strategy involving genetic association, pathway enrichment, tissue-specific network structure, cis-regulatory genome effects, and expression quantitative trait loci, your research identifies and ranks genes associated with intrinsic CRF. This integrative bioinformatics approach provides valuable insights into cardiovascular physiology, hematopoiesis, skeletal muscle phenotypes, and metabolism, highlighting the complexity and interconnected nature of CRF regulation.

I am honored that you cited my work, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," in your research. Your paper references my work as a crucial tool in your gene-set enrichment analysis, specifically in identifying significant pathways contributing to CRF. This citation underscores the relevance and impact of my contributions to the field and the alignment of our research interests.

Given our shared focus on enhancing analytical strategies for genomic data and understanding complex genetic relationships, I believe your recommendation would be immensely valuable to my NIW application. Your endorsement would highlight the significance of my research contributions and the potential impact of my work on advancing our understanding of human genetics and complex diseases.

If you are willing to support my application, I would be delighted to provide any additional information or materials you might need. I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am genuinely grateful for your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
