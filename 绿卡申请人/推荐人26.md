**Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application**

Dear Dr. Anthony T. Tan,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am reaching out to seek your support as a potential recommender.

I have closely followed your impactful research, particularly your article titled "Adoptive T-cell therapy for HBV-associated HCC and HBV infection." Your pioneering work on adoptive T-cell immunotherapy has provided valuable insights into potential treatments for chronic HBV and HBV-HCC. The depth of your research, especially on the therapeutic potential and safety considerations of T-cell therapy, aligns closely with my own research interests and contributions.

In my recent work, I have focused on studying the clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using single-cell genome sequencing. My research, particularly the paper "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," has contributed to understanding the stability of HBV integrations during tumor progression. This finding supports the idea that T-cell therapy targeting HBV antigens could be applicable across multiple tumor nodules and patients, reinforcing the therapeutic approaches discussed in your paper.

Given our shared research interests and the relevance of your work to my field, I believe your recommendation would significantly strengthen my application. Your endorsement would highlight the importance of continued research and development in this critical area of medical science.

I would be honored if you could consider writing a recommendation letter on my behalf. I am more than happy to provide any additional information or discuss my research in further detail if needed. Please feel free to reach me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
