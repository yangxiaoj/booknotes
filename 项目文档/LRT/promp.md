You are an expert of bioinformatics, please complete the following tastks:
1. carefully read the project description:

## scRNA group description: 

PHT: primary hepatocellular carcinoma tumor scRNA-seq data;
LRT: late relapsed hepatocellular carcinoma tumor scRNA-seq data;
PHN: adjacent primary hepatocellular carcinoma normal tissue scRNA-seq data;
LRN: adjacent late relapsed hepatocellular carcinoma normal tissue scRNA-seq data;

## scATAC group description:

PH represents primary hepatocellular carcinoma tumor scATAC data;
LR represents late hepatocellular carcinoma tumor scATAC data;


2. carefully read the module description:


This is the UMAP of tumor cells from different samples. Each dot represents a cell, and the color represents the sample ID.





3. rewrite the figure results part (in triple quotes) in a more readable way and can be published in Nature Journal:
'''
The UMAP shows that tumour cell clusters tended to be patient specific.



'''
4. Pls Explain the biological meaning of the figure results.



5. The output should be following the format: RESULTS OUTPUT(pls don't  use mark down format):
