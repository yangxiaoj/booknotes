Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Dr. Barthold,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support in my application for a green card through the National Interest Waiver (NIW) process. Given your expertise and the intersection of our research interests, I would be honored if you could provide a letter of recommendation on my behalf.

I have greatly admired your work, particularly your publication titled, "Pathway analysis supports association of nonsyndromic cryptorchidism with genetic loci linked to cytoskeleton-dependent functions." Your research offers significant insights into the genetic susceptibility to nonsyndromic cryptorchidism, highlighting the heterogeneity of the disease and the involvement of cytoskeleton-dependent functions. The depth of your pathway analysis and the use of bioinformatics tools to elucidate the genetic associations have been particularly inspiring for my own work.

In your study, you referenced my work, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," which I believe supports the validity and impact of pathway enrichment analyses in understanding complex genetic traits. Specifically, the application of i-GSEA4GWAS in your pathway analysis demonstrates the utility of my methodology in identifying and interpreting the functional significance of genetic loci associated with cryptorchidism.

Given this connection and the alignment of our research, I am hopeful that you might consider writing a recommendation letter that emphasizes the significance of my contributions to the field of bioinformatics and genetic research. Your endorsement would be invaluable in illustrating the broader impact of my work and its relevance to public health and scientific advancement.

Please let me know if you would be willing to assist me in this endeavor. I would be happy to provide any additional information or discuss this request further at your convenience. Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
