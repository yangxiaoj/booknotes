Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Dr. Titilayo Omolara Johnson,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am reaching out to you to request your support in my application for a green card. 

I have been greatly inspired by your work, especially your recent article, "Modern drug discovery for inflammatory bowel disease: The role of computational methods," published in 2023. Your comprehensive review on the role of computational methods in drug discovery for IBD has been incredibly influential in my own research. 

In my work, I have focused on integrating computational techniques into gene set enrichment analysis. One of my notable contributions is the development of the web server, i-GSEA4GWAS, which has been cited in your article. Specifically, in your discussion on computational methods for IBD drug discovery, you referenced my work in the context of pathway analysis and gene set enrichment. I am honored that my research has contributed to your insightful review and aligns with the advancements in computational drug discovery methodologies that you advocate.

Given your expertise and significant contributions to the field, I would be deeply grateful if you could consider writing a recommendation letter for me. Your endorsement would be invaluable to my application and would greatly enhance my chances of success.

I am happy to provide any additional information or documents that may assist you in writing the recommendation. Please feel free to reach out to me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org or via phone at your convenience.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of your support and am grateful for your time and assistance.

Warm regards,

Sijia Cui
