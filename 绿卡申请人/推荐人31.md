**Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application**

**Dear Dr. Pastore,**

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category, and I am seeking esteemed professionals who can provide a recommendation letter to support my application. Given your prominent position in the field and our shared research interests, I am writing to request your assistance in this regard.

I have been greatly influenced by your article, "Identification of a Novel Transcription Factor Required for Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells," published in *Stem Cells*. Your work provided a comprehensive analysis of the role of a novel transcription factor, osteoblast inducer (ObI)-1, in the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts. Your findings on the BMP signaling pathway and its interaction with ObI-1 have significantly advanced our understanding of osteogenic differentiation.

In your article, you referenced my work titled "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing,". Specifically, my study's findings on the clonal evolution and genetic diversity in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) patients, revealed through advanced single-cell genome sequencing techniques, provided crucial insights that complemented your analysis of the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in cell differentiation. The integration of our findings has helped elucidate the molecular processes driving MSC differentiation and clonal evolution in various cellular contexts.

Given our shared research focus and the synergy between our work, I believe that your recommendation would carry significant weight in demonstrating the impact and importance of my research contributions. Your letter would not only endorse my professional capabilities and achievements but also highlight the relevance of my work to ongoing advancements in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine.

I understand that writing such a letter requires time and effort, and I greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide. I am happy to provide you with any additional information or materials you may need to facilitate this process. Please let me know if you require a draft or any specific details about my research and accomplishments.

Thank you very much for considering my request. Your support would be invaluable to me, and I am deeply grateful for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Sijia Cui
