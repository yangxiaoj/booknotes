Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Boezen,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support for my green card application through the National Interest Waiver (NIW) by requesting a recommendation letter from you.

I have long admired your research, particularly your insightful article titled "Genes and pathways underlying susceptibility to impaired lung function in the context of environmental tobacco smoke exposure." Your work has significantly contributed to our understanding of the genetic factors and biological pathways involved in the susceptibility to impaired lung function due to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure.

In your article, you used a genome-wide interaction (GWI) study to identify novel susceptibility loci and explored biological pathways underlying the susceptibility to impaired forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in the context of ETS exposure. The identification of significant interactions and the enrichment of the apoptosis, p38 MAPK, and TNF pathways provide valuable insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms contributing to lung function impairment.

Notably, your study references my work on the "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." My work provided a powerful tool for pathway-based analysis in genome-wide studies, facilitating the identification of gene sets and pathways associated with complex traits. The application of my methods in your pathway analysis underscores the synergy between our research contributions.

Given our shared commitment to advancing genetic research and improving public health outcomes, I would be honored to have your support in my NIW application. Your recommendation would provide a strong testament to my contributions and potential in the field of bioinformatics and genetic research.

I would be happy to provide any additional information or discuss this request further at your convenience. Thank you very much for considering my request. I deeply appreciate your time and support.

Best regards,
