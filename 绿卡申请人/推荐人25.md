Subject: Request for Recommendation for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Bertoletti,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am currently in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am seeking strong letters of recommendation to support my application. Given your esteemed position and expertise in the field, I am writing to kindly ask if you would be willing to serve as one of my recommenders.

I have been greatly inspired by your work, particularly your article titled "Use of Expression Profiles of HBV-DNA Integrated Into Genomes of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells to Select T Cells for Immunotherapy." Your groundbreaking research on the use of integrated HBV-DNA fragments to select HBV-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) for personalized immunotherapy has significantly advanced our understanding and approach to treating HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 

In your article, you demonstrated how HCC cells that do not express whole HBV antigens contain short HBV mRNAs, which encode epitopes recognized by T cells. This discovery underlines the potential for HBV transcriptomes of these cells to guide the engineering of T cells for personalized immunotherapy, offering a novel and promising avenue for treating HBV-associated HCC. 

My research has also contributed to this field, particularly in the area of single-cell genome sequencing of HBV-HCC cells. In my publication titled "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," I explored the genetic diversity and clonal evolution of HBV-related HCC. This work provides a detailed understanding of the integration patterns and timing of HBV-DNA in liver cancer and HBV-infected livers, supporting the premise of using HBV-specific T-cell therapies as you have proposed.

I believe that your endorsement would greatly strengthen my application, highlighting the relevance and impact of my work in the broader context of ongoing research in the field. If you are able to provide a letter of recommendation, I would be more than happy to provide any additional information or materials you may need.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I understand that you have a very busy schedule and I deeply appreciate your time and assistance.

Best regards,
