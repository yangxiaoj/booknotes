Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Santiago Vernia,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been deeply inspired by your article titled "A Transposon-Based Mouse Model of Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Hydrodynamic Tail Vein Injection." Your innovative approach utilizing the Sleeping Beauty transposon system to induce HCC in mice has provided a valuable model for studying the mechanisms of liver cancer. The method you described, which involves the expression of a hyperactive form of N-RAS, N-RASG12V, while silencing the endogenous Trp53 gene, has greatly influenced my own research methodologies.

I would be honored if you could reference my work in your letter. My recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," intersects with your research in exploring the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocellular carcinoma. Specifically, your use of transposon-based models to study tumorigenesis aligns closely with my findings on the clonal evolution and genomic diversity in HBV-related HCC. My work further elucidates how single-cell genome sequencing can reveal the intricate details of tumor heterogeneity and the mechanisms driving malignant transformation.

A recommendation from a distinguished researcher such as yourself, who has significantly contributed to the field of HCC research, would be invaluable to my application. Your endorsement would not only attest to my expertise and contributions to the field but also underscore the broader impact of my research on understanding HCC pathogenesis.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I greatly appreciate any time you can spare to assist me in this important step of my career. If you need any additional information or context for the letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
