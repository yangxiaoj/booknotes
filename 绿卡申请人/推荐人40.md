Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Dr. Harari,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to you to seek your support and recommendation for my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I have been closely following your work, and I am particularly impressed by your paper titled "Integrative system biology analyses of CRISPR-edited iPSC-derived neurons and human brains reveal deficiencies of presynaptic signaling in FTLD and PSP." The comprehensive approach you employed to unravel the pathogenic events triggered by the MAPT p.R406W mutation, and the significant findings on the dysregulation of GABA receptor genes, have been highly inspirational and influential in my own research endeavors.

In your paper, you referenced my work, specifically the study on i-GSEA4GWAS titled "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." Your application of the improved gene set enrichment analysis to identify significant pathways and networks associated with neurodegenerative diseases provided a valuable context to your findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying FTLD and PSP.

Given your esteemed position in the field and the overlap in our research interests, I would be truly honored if you could provide a recommendation letter highlighting my contributions to bioinformatics and the broader scientific community. Your endorsement would significantly bolster my application and help demonstrate the impact of my work in advancing our understanding of complex genetic traits and diseases.

I am more than willing to provide any additional information or documentation that you might need to support my request. Thank you very much for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of your support and am hopeful for a positive response.

Warm regards,
