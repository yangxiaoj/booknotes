Subject: Request for Recommendation for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Renieri,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California. I am currently in the process of applying for a Green Card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category, and I am writing to request your support as a recommender for my application.

I have been greatly impressed by your work, particularly your article titled "Clinical and molecular characterization of COVID-19 hospitalized patients," published in PLoS ONE. Your research on the clinical and molecular characterization of COVID-19 patients, specifically through Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), has significantly contributed to our understanding of the genetic factors influencing COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. I found your analysis on the identification of common and rare genetic variants particularly enlightening, as it aligns with my research interests and expertise in bioinformatics and genomic analysis.

In my work, I have also focused on understanding complex genetic factors, as demonstrated in my publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing." In this paper, I explored the genetic heterogeneity and clonal evolution of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma using advanced single-cell genome sequencing techniques. I believe there are several intersections between our research, particularly in the application of genomic technologies to elucidate disease mechanisms.

I am honored to request your recommendation for my Green Card application, as your endorsement would significantly strengthen my case. I would greatly appreciate it if you could highlight our shared research interests, the importance of my work in the field of bioinformatics and genomics, and my contributions to advancing scientific knowledge in these areas.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or materials from me to facilitate this process. I am more than willing to provide drafts, outlines, or any specific details that you may need.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
