Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Amanda Jean Craig,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been deeply inspired by your article titled "Molecular Carcinogenesis of Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma." Your comprehensive review of the oncogenic mechanisms of HBV, including both indirect pathways through chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as direct contributions through HBx protein and HBV genome integration, has been incredibly insightful for my research. The detailed analysis of genomic instability, telomere shortening, and molecular classification of HBV-related HCC as Proliferative with poorer prognosis, has significantly influenced my understanding and approach to studying HCC.

I would be honored if you could reference my work in your letter. My recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," intersects with your research in terms of exploring the clonal evolution and genomic alterations in HBV-related HCC. Specifically, your discussion on the role of genomic instability and integration sites aligns closely with my findings on the diverse clonal evolution modes in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. My work further elucidates how single-cell genome sequencing can reveal the intricate details of tumor heterogeneity and the mechanisms driving malignant transformation.

A recommendation from a distinguished researcher such as yourself, who has significantly contributed to the field of HBV-related HCC research, would be invaluable to my application. Your endorsement would not only attest to my expertise and contributions to the field but also underscore the broader impact of my research on understanding HBV-related carcinogenesis.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I greatly appreciate any time you can spare to assist me in this important step of my career. If you need any additional information or context for the letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
