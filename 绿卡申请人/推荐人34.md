Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter

Dear Dr. Anastasiya V. Snezhkina,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category and am writing to request your support in the form of a recommendation letter.

I have been greatly impressed by your work, particularly your case report on "Multiple paragangliomas: a case report." Your detailed analysis of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of multiple paragangliomas has been a significant source of inspiration for my research. I found your identification of the germline variant in the SDHD gene and the different spectra of somatic variants in each tumor particularly insightful.

I would be honored if you could reference my work in your letter. My recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," intersects with your research in terms of utilizing single-cell sequencing to reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify potential disease biomarkers. Specifically, your findings on the SDHD gene's role in multiple paragangliomas align closely with my work, which highlights the importance of single-cell genome sequencing in understanding tumor heterogeneity and evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma.

A recommendation from a distinguished researcher such as yourself, who has significantly contributed to the field of genetic and molecular mechanisms of rare tumors, would be invaluable to my application. Your endorsement would not only attest to my expertise and contributions to the field but also underscore the broader impact of my research.

Thank you for considering my request. I understand that you have a busy schedule, and I greatly appreciate any time you can spare to assist me in this important step of my career. If you need any additional information or context for the letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,

Sijia Cui
