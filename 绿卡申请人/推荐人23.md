### Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Professor Irene Oi-Lin Ng,

I hope this email finds you well.

My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) program, and part of the application requires me to gather recommendation letters from distinguished experts in my field. Given your remarkable work and contributions to the field of liver cancer research, I am writing to ask if you would be willing to write a recommendation letter for me.

Your paper, "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals the landscape of intra-tumoral heterogeneity and stemness-related subpopulations in liver cancer," has significantly influenced my research. I am particularly impressed by how you utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect intra-tumoral heterogeneity and identify rare but crucial cell subpopulations within hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Your findings on the EPCAM+ cell populations and the CD24+/CD44+-enriched subpopulation have provided valuable insights into the complexities of cancer stem cell biology and tumor behavior.

In my recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," I explored the clonal evolution and heterogeneity of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Your work has been pivotal in shaping my understanding of single-cell approaches to unravel the complexities of tumor heterogeneity. Specifically, I cited your study in the context of analyzing stemness-related subpopulations and the implications for tumor progression and treatment resistance.

Having your endorsement would greatly strengthen my application, highlighting the relevance and impact of my work in the broader context of cancer research. Your recommendation would be invaluable in demonstrating my contributions to the field and my potential for future advancements.

If you are willing to support me, I would be happy to provide any additional information or materials you might need. Please feel free to contact me at Sijia.Cui@cshs.org.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of your support.

Warm regards,
