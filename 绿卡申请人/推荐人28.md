**Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application**

**Dear Dr. Balakrishnan,**

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am in the process of applying for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category, and I am seeking esteemed professionals who can provide a recommendation letter to support my application. Given your prominent position in the field and our shared research interests, I am writing to request your assistance in this regard.

I have been greatly influenced by your article, "The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stage carcinogenesis is associated with genomic instability features," published in *Cancer Research*. Your work provided an in-depth analysis of the mutational background and genomic instability features associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Your findings, particularly regarding the activation of DNA-dependent gene sets such as epigenetic modifications, DNA repair, and DNA damage response, have significantly advanced our understanding of the genomic dysregulation in HCC tumors.

In your article, you referenced my work titled "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing." Specifically, my study's findings on the clonal evolution and genetic diversity in HBV-related HCC patients, which were revealed through advanced single-cell genome sequencing techniques, provided crucial insights that complemented your analysis of genomic instability features. The integration of our findings has helped elucidate the complex mutational landscape and evolutionary dynamics of HCC, reinforcing the importance of genomic instability in liver cancer progression.

Given our shared research focus and the synergy between our work, I believe that your recommendation would carry significant weight in demonstrating the impact and importance of my research contributions. Your letter would not only endorse my professional capabilities and achievements but also highlight the relevance of my work to ongoing advancements in the field of HCC research.

I understand that writing such a letter requires time and effort, and I greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide. I am happy to provide you with any additional information or materials you may need to facilitate this process. Please let me know if you require a draft or any specific details about my research and accomplishments.

Thank you very much for considering my request. Your support would be invaluable to me, and I am deeply grateful for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Sijia Cui
