Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Professor Conley,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am reaching out to request your support in writing a recommendation letter for my green card application.

Your groundbreaking work on identifying variance-controlling quantitative trait loci (vQTLs) through sibling models, particularly the study titled "A sibling method for identifying vQTLs" published in PLoS ONE, has been highly influential in my own research. Your innovative approach to using genetic relatedness within families to obtain unbiased estimates of variance effects rather than treating it as a complicating factor has inspired many aspects of my work.

In your study, you effectively demonstrated that the family-based approach not only controls for parental genotype, mean effects, and non-linear effects but also performs significantly better than existing methods like squared Z-score and DGLM in the presence of confounding. This methodological advancement has had a profound impact on my research, particularly in understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.

One of my key contributions to the field has been the development of the i-GSEA4GWAS web server, which facilitates the identification of pathways and gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association studies. Your work has provided a crucial foundation for my approach to integrating genetic data with pathway analysis, and I have frequently cited your study to support the validity and relevance of this methodology.

Given the alignment of our research interests and your substantial influence on my work, I would be deeply honored if you could provide a recommendation letter for my green card application. Your endorsement would significantly strengthen my case, highlighting the importance and impact of my contributions to the field of bioinformatics and genomics.

I would be happy to provide any additional information you might need and to discuss this further at your convenience. Thank you very much for considering my request.

Best regards,
