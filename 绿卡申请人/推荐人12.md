Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Karthik Balakrishnan,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am reaching out to request your support in writing a recommendation letter for my green card application.

I have been greatly inspired by your work, particularly your article "The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stage carcinogenesis is associated with genomic instability features." Your comprehensive investigation into the mutational background of HCC tumors and the identification of genomic instability features have provided significant insights into the carcinogenesis and progression of liver cancer. Your detailed analysis of DNA-dependent gene sets and their dysregulation in HCC stages has greatly influenced my research.

In my recent publication, "Diverse modes of clonal evolution in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma revealed by single-cell genome sequencing," I have cited your work to emphasize the role of genomic instability in liver cancer progression. Specifically, I referenced your findings on the activation of genomic instability-related gene sets, including epigenetic modifications, DNA damage response dysregulation, and replication stress, which are critical for understanding the clonal evolution and heterogeneity of HCC tumors.

Your pioneering work has been instrumental in shaping my research direction, and I believe your recommendation would be invaluable for my green card application. Your endorsement would significantly strengthen my case, highlighting the impact and relevance of my research in the field of bioinformatics and cancer genomics.

If you are willing to support my application by writing a recommendation letter, I would be more than happy to provide any additional information or documents you may need. Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,

Sijia Cui
