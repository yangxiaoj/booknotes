**Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for National Interest Waiver Application**

Dear Mr. S. H. Witt,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to you to seek your support and request a recommendation letter for my National Interest Waiver (NIW) application.

I have been following your impressive work closely, particularly your publication titled "Genome-wide association study of borderline personality disorder reveals genetic overlap with bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia." Your pioneering research in this area, especially the identification of genetic overlaps between BOR, BIP, MDD, and SCZ, has greatly influenced my own work and inspired me to delve deeper into genetic research.

In your article, you discussed the significant findings of DPYD and PKP4 genes, as well as the exocytosis gene set, which you identified using i-GSEA4GWASv2. My work, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," aligns closely with this aspect of your research. Specifically, your use of i-GSEA4GWASv2 for gene-set analysis in your study underscores the relevance and applicability of my work in advancing the understanding of complex genetic traits.

Given your esteemed position and significant contributions to the field, a recommendation letter from you would be incredibly valuable for my NIW application. Your endorsement would not only highlight the importance and impact of my research but also reinforce my commitment to contributing to the scientific community and advancing public health through bioinformatics.

I understand the demands on your time and would be deeply grateful for your consideration of this request. If you require any additional information or details to support your recommendation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Sijia Cui
