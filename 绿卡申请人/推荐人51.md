Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Julià,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support for my green card application through the National Interest Waiver (NIW) by requesting a recommendation letter from you.

Given your esteemed research in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly your insightful article titled "Genome-wide pathway analysis identifies VEGF pathway association with oral ulceration in systemic lupus erythematosus," I believe your endorsement would significantly strengthen my application. Your work has significantly contributed to the understanding of the genetic basis underlying the clinical heterogeneity of SLE, particularly in identifying the VEGF pathway's association with oral ulceration.

In your article, you utilized a two-stage pathway-based approach to uncover the genetic variations associated with SLE phenotypes. Your discovery of the significant association between the VEGF pathway and oral ulceration, and the subsequent validation of this finding, highlights the potential for targeted therapies in managing this condition. This pioneering work aligns closely with my research interests and methodologies, particularly the use of pathway-based analyses to identify genetic variations.

Notably, your article references my work on the "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study." My work has provided a valuable tool for pathway-based analysis in genome-wide studies, facilitating the identification of genetic pathways involved in complex diseases such as SLE. The integration of my methods in your research underscores the synergy between our contributions to the field.

Given our shared commitment to advancing genetic research and improving patient outcomes, I would be honored to have your support in my NIW application. Your recommendation would provide a strong testament to my contributions and potential in the field of bioinformatics and genetic research.

I would be happy to provide any additional information or discuss this request further at your convenience. Thank you very much for considering my request. I deeply appreciate your time and support.

Best regards,
