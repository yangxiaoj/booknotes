Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Professor Papassotiropoulos,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support in my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I am reaching out to you because of your outstanding contributions to the field of genetics, particularly through your seminal work on the genetics of human episodic memory. Your paper, "Genetics of human episodic memory: dealing with complexity," has been a significant inspiration for my research. Your insights into the polygenic nature of episodic memory and the potential for identifying trait-associated molecules and pathways have profoundly influenced my approach to gene set enrichment analysis.

In your paper, you emphasize the importance of integrating high-throughput genotyping methods, advanced statistical analyses, and neural systems-level phenotypic assessments to uncover novel memory-related genes. Your discussion on the necessary crosstalk between behavioral genetic studies and molecular genetic investigations resonates deeply with my own work. I am particularly honored that you cited my paper, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," in your discussion. This citation underscores the relevance of my contributions to the field and the alignment of our research interests.

Given our shared focus on understanding complex genetic traits and my admiration for your work, I believe your recommendation would be immensely valuable to my NIW application. Your endorsement would highlight the significance of my research contributions and the potential impact of my work on advancing our understanding of human genetics.

If you are willing to support my application, I would be delighted to provide any additional information or materials you might need. I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am genuinely grateful for your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
