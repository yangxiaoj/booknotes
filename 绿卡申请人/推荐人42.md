Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Marczyk,

I hope this email finds you well. I am Sijia Cui, currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to you with a humble request for your support in my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I am reaching out to you because of our shared professional interests and the valuable impact your research has had on my own work. In particular, I have been greatly influenced by your seminal paper, "Ranking metrics in gene set enrichment analysis: do they matter?" which has profoundly shaped my understanding and approach to gene set enrichment analysis.

In your paper, you provide a comprehensive evaluation of different ranking metrics in gene set analysis, highlighting the critical impact of metric choice on pathway enrichment results. Your findings on the performance of various ranking metrics, such as the absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic and the Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic, have been instrumental in refining my methods and enhancing the robustness of my analyses.

Furthermore, I was honored to see my own work cited in your publication. Specifically, you referenced my paper, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," in your discussion of gene set analysis methodologies. Your acknowledgment of my contribution to the field is something I deeply appreciate.

Given our mutual interests and the recognition of my work in your research, I believe your recommendation would significantly strengthen my NIW application. Your endorsement would not only highlight the importance of my contributions to the field of bioinformatics but also underscore the collaborative nature of our scientific endeavors.

If you are willing to support my application, I would be more than happy to provide any additional information or materials you might need. I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am truly grateful for your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
