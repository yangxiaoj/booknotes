Subject: Request for Recommendation Letter for Green Card Application

Dear Dr. Amos,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sijia Cui, and I am currently working as a Bioinformatics Project Scientist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. I am writing to seek your support in my application for a green card under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category.

I am reaching out to you because of your significant contributions to the field of genomics and bioinformatics, particularly through your outstanding work on pathway-based analysis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) genome-wide association studies. Your paper, "Pathway-based analysis of primary biliary cirrhosis genome-wide association studies," has been particularly impactful to my research.

In your paper, you discuss the application of pathway analysis to complement conventional GWAS analysis and highlight the identification of significant pathways related to PBC susceptibility. Your findings, such as the association of the phosphatidylinositol signaling and hedgehog signaling pathways with PBC, have provided valuable insights into the genetic architecture of this complex autoimmune disease.

I am honored that you cited my work, "i-GSEA4GWAS: a web server for identification of pathways/gene sets associated with traits by applying an improved gene set enrichment analysis to genome-wide association study," in your research. Your paper references my work as a crucial tool in your pathway enrichment analysis, specifically in identifying significant pathways and biological processes relevant to GWAS data. This citation underscores the relevance and impact of my contributions to the field and the alignment of our research interests.

Given our shared focus on enhancing the analytical strategies for genomic data, I believe your recommendation would be immensely valuable to my NIW application. Your endorsement would highlight the significance of my research contributions and the potential impact of my work on advancing our understanding of human genetics and complex diseases.

If you are willing to support my application, I would be delighted to provide any additional information or materials you might need. I understand that writing a recommendation letter is a significant commitment, and I am genuinely grateful for your consideration.

Thank you very much for your time and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
